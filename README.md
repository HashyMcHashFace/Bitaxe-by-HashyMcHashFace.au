## 💡 Overview

The **Bitaxe Family** represents the latest generation of open-source Bitcoin ASIC miners — compact, efficient, and completely self-contained.  
Each variant is engineered to deliver professional-grade performance while remaining transparent, hackable, and affordable.

These miners connect directly to your Wi-Fi network and begin mining to your own Bitcoin node or preferred pool.  
No Raspberry Pi. No controller board. Just power, Wi-Fi, and pure SHA-256 performance.

---

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Standalone mining:** Directly connects to your pool or node over Wi-Fi — no host computer required.  
- **Smart control:** Web-based interface with live telemetry, temperature, and performance stats.  
- **Custom firmware:** Powered by community-maintained ESP-Miner / AxeOS variants.  
- **Energy-efficient:** Optimised voltage and frequency control for maximum efficiency.  
- **Open-source design:** All hardware, firmware, and schematics are publicly available.
